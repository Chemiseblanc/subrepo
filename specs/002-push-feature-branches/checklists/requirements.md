# Specification Quality Checklist: Feature Branch Push Synchronization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**All items passed validation:**

- Content quality: The spec avoids all implementation details. It uses generic terms like "system," "component," and "repository" without mentioning specific technologies, git commands, or code structures.
- Requirements: All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Each requirement clearly states what MUST happen without dictating how.
- Success criteria: All 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. They focus on user-facing outcomes (e.g., "developers can push," "100% of operations") rather than technical metrics.
- User scenarios: Three prioritized user stories cover the core use case (P1), backward compatibility (P2), and multi-component scenarios (P2). Each includes acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format.
- Edge cases: Five relevant edge cases identified covering error scenarios, boundary conditions, and conflict handling.
- Scope: The feature is clearly bounded to branch detection and component pushing behavior. Assumptions section clearly states what is expected to be in place.
- No clarification markers: The spec makes reasonable assumptions (documented in Assumptions section) and doesn't require additional clarification.

**Specification is ready for planning phase.**
