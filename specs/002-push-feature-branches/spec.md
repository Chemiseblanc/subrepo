# Feature Specification: Feature Branch Push Synchronization

**Feature Branch**: `002-push-feature-branches`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "When the repo is not on the default branch, pushing a component should push to the same branch, creating it if necessary. This is to enable work on a local feature branch to be pushed to upstream feature branches across the various repos."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: How should the system determine the default branch for each component? → A: Read default branch from manifest for each component, fall back to git detection if not specified. When manifest specifies a commit instead of a branch, fall back to git detection.
- Q: What should happen when local and remote branch histories diverge (non-fast-forward)? → A: Fail the push and require explicit user action/flag to force
- Q: When pushing multiple components and some fail, should the operation continue or stop? → A: Continue pushing remaining components, report all results at end
- Q: What should happen when the remote repository doesn't exist? → A: Fail with clear error message requiring manual repository creation
- Q: What should happen when the local branch name conflicts with a protected branch pattern? → A: Fail with clear error message identifying the protection conflict

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Push Component from Feature Branch (Priority: P1)

A developer working on a feature branch in the monorepo needs to push changes for a specific component to its upstream repository, maintaining the same branch name to enable coordinated feature development across repositories.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables distributed feature development. Without this, developers cannot maintain branch parity across component repositories when working on features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a local feature branch, making changes to a component, pushing that component, and verifying the remote repository has a matching feature branch with the changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer is on a feature branch (e.g., "feature-auth"), **When** they push a component to its upstream repository, **Then** the changes are pushed to a branch named "feature-auth" in the component's remote repository
2. **Given** a developer is on a feature branch and the remote repository does not have a matching branch, **When** they push the component, **Then** the matching branch is created automatically in the remote repository
3. **Given** a developer is on a feature branch and the remote repository already has a matching branch, **When** they push the component, **Then** the existing remote branch is updated with the new changes
4. **Given** a developer is on a feature branch and the remote branch has diverged (non-fast-forward), **When** they push the component, **Then** the push fails with a clear error message indicating the need for explicit force flag
5. **Given** a developer attempts to push a component whose remote repository does not exist, **When** the push is attempted, **Then** the operation fails with a clear error message instructing the user to create the repository manually
6. **Given** a developer is on a branch whose name matches a protected branch pattern in the remote repository, **When** they attempt to push, **Then** the operation fails with a clear error message identifying the branch protection conflict

### User Story 2 - Default Branch Behavior Unchanged (Priority: P2)

A developer working on the default branch pushes component changes using the existing default behavior, ensuring backward compatibility with current workflows.

**Why this priority**: Maintains existing workflows and prevents breaking changes. This ensures the tool continues to work as expected for the common case of working on the default branch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by checking out the default branch, making component changes, pushing, and verifying the push targets the default branch in the remote repository as it did before this feature.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer is on the default branch (e.g., "main"), **When** they push a component, **Then** the changes are pushed to the default branch in the component's remote repository
2. **Given** a developer is on the default branch, **When** they push a component, **Then** no new branches are created in the remote repository

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-Component Feature Branch Push (Priority: P2)

A developer working on a feature that spans multiple components needs to push all modified components to their respective repositories, each maintaining the same feature branch name.

**Why this priority**: Many features span multiple components. Being able to push all components at once with consistent branch names streamlines the development workflow and reduces manual coordination.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a feature branch, modifying multiple components, pushing all of them in a single operation, and verifying each component repository has a matching feature branch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer is on a feature branch with changes to multiple components, **When** they push all components, **Then** each component repository receives the changes on a branch matching the current feature branch name
2. **Given** some component repositories already have the matching feature branch and others don't, **When** all components are pushed, **Then** existing branches are updated and missing branches are created automatically
3. **Given** a developer pushes multiple components and some fail due to errors, **When** the push operation completes, **Then** all remaining components are still attempted and a summary report shows which succeeded and which failed with specific error details

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the manifest specifies a commit SHA instead of a branch reference?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when the current local branch is not the default branch
- **FR-002**: System MUST determine the default branch name by first checking the manifest for each component, then falling back to git detection (symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD) if not specified or if manifest specifies a commit instead of a branch
- **FR-003**: System MUST push component changes to a remote branch matching the current local branch name when not on the default branch
- **FR-004**: System MUST create the remote branch automatically if it does not exist in the component repository
- **FR-005**: System MUST update the existing remote branch if it already exists and the push can fast-forward
- **FR-006**: System MUST fail the push operation when the remote branch exists but has diverged from local (non-fast-forward scenario), requiring explicit user action
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the existing push behavior (pushing to default branch) when the local branch is the default branch
- **FR-008**: System MUST support pushing multiple components in a single operation, each to their respective remote repositories with matching branch names
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide feedback to the user indicating which branches were created vs updated in remote repositories
- **FR-010**: System MUST continue attempting to push all components even when individual component pushes fail, then report all successes and failures
- **FR-011**: System MUST set up remote branch tracking when creating new remote branches
- **FR-012**: System MUST parse the manifest to extract component metadata including default branch references and commit SHAs
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide clear error messages when push is rejected due to diverged histories, indicating the specific component and suggesting resolution steps
- **FR-014**: System MUST generate a summary report after multi-component push showing each component's status (success/failure), error details for failures, and counts of created vs updated branches
- **FR-015**: System MUST fail with a clear error message when attempting to push to a non-existent remote repository, instructing the user to create the repository through proper channels
- **FR-016**: System MUST detect when the local branch name matches a protected branch pattern in the remote repository and fail with a clear error message identifying the protection conflict

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Local Branch**: The current git branch in the monorepo, identified by name (e.g., "002-push-feature-branches")
- **Default Branch**: The primary branch of the repository (e.g., "main", "master"), sourced from manifest first, then git configuration as fallback
- **Component**: A subtree or submodule managed by the tool, with its own remote repository
- **Remote Branch**: A branch in the component's remote repository, matched by name to the local branch
- **Push Operation**: An atomic operation that transfers commits from local to remote, potentially creating or updating remote branches
- **Manifest**: A configuration file that defines components and their metadata including repository URLs, default branches, and commit references
- **Push Result**: The outcome of a push operation for a single component, containing status (success/failure), action taken (created/updated), and error details if applicable
- **Protected Branch Pattern**: A naming pattern or rule in the remote repository that prevents branch creation or modification (e.g., "release/*", "hotfix/*")

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can push component changes from any feature branch and automatically have matching branches created in component repositories
- **SC-002**: 100% of push operations correctly identify whether the current branch is the default branch
- **SC-003**: When pushing to a non-existent remote branch, the branch is created successfully without requiring manual intervention
- **SC-004**: Developers receive clear feedback about branch creation vs updates for each component pushed
- **SC-005**: Push operations on the default branch continue to work exactly as they did before this feature (zero regression)
- **SC-006**: Multi-component pushes complete in the same time as individual pushes would take sequentially (no performance degradation)
- **SC-007**: When manifest specifies a commit SHA, system correctly falls back to git detection for default branch determination
- **SC-008**: 100% of non-fast-forward scenarios result in failed push with actionable error message (no data loss from automatic force pushes)
- **SC-009**: When pushing 10 components with 3 failures, all 7 successful pushes complete and the summary report accurately identifies all 3 failures with specific error details
- **SC-010**: When attempting to push to a non-existent remote repository, the operation fails immediately with a clear error message identifying the missing repository
- **SC-011**: When attempting to create a branch matching a protected branch pattern, the operation fails with a clear error message identifying the specific protection rule that was violated

## Assumptions

- The manifest file exists and is parseable
- The manifest may specify either branch names or commit SHAs for components
- Developers have push permissions to the remote component repositories
- The remote repositories already exist and are accessible (system does not create repositories)
- Standard git push behavior applies (fast-forward merges preferred, conflicts require manual resolution)
- Branch names are valid git branch names (no special characters that would cause issues across repositories)
- Force push capability will be provided through an explicit flag/option when needed
- Failed component pushes do not roll back successful pushes (non-transactional operation)
- Repository creation is handled through organizational processes, not by this tool
- Protected branch patterns are configured and enforced by the remote git hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
