# Specification Quality Checklist: Git Subtree Repo Manager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been verified:

- **Content Quality**: The specification focuses purely on WHAT and WHY without mentioning specific technologies (only git subtree as the approach, which is a user-facing requirement). Written in business language describing developer workflows.

- **Requirement Completeness**: All 18 functional requirements are specific and testable. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - the spec makes informed decisions based on standard repo manifest format and git subtree capabilities. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.

- **Feature Readiness**: 5 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P5), each independently testable. All acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format. Edge cases comprehensively identified.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No issues requiring spec updates
- User stories prioritized to enable MVP delivery (P1 = init, P2 = sync)
