# Tasks: Git Subtree Repo Manager

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-git-subtree-repo/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per constitution requirement (TDD non-negotiable), all user stories include test tasks that MUST be written and fail before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow single project structure per plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project directory structure (src/, tests/{contract,integration,unit}/)
- [X] T002 [P] Initialize pyproject.toml with Python 3.14+ requirement and zero runtime dependencies
- [X] T003 [P] Create src/__init__.py with package metadata

- [X] T009 [P] Create .gitignore with Python patterns, .subrepo/, __pycache__, etc.
- [X] T010 [P] Create tests/integration/fixtures/ directory for test manifest XML files

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Init)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Sync)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3 - Push)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 & US2 foundation but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4 - Pull)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 & US2 foundation but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5 - Status)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 & US2 foundation but independently testable

**Note**: While US2-5 extend US1 capabilities, each user story is independently testable. US1 provides the workspace initialization, but subsequent stories can be developed and tested in parallel once foundational phase completes.

### Within Each User Story

**TDD Cycle (NON-NEGOTIABLE per constitution)**:
1. **RED**: Write tests FIRST (contract, integration, unit tests for the story)
2. **Verify**: Ensure all tests FAIL (proving they actually test the missing functionality)
3. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
4. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

**Task order within story**:
- Tests (contract ‚Üí integration ‚Üí unit) - ALL MUST FAIL before implementation
- Models/data structures
- Core business logic
- CLI command handlers
- Flags and options
- Error handling and reporting

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, user stories can be developed in parallel by different developers
- Within each story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Init)

```bash
# RED Phase - Launch all test creation tasks together:
Task T020: "Contract test for init command success case in tests/contract/test_cli_init.py"
Task T021: "Contract test for init command with non-empty directory in tests/contract/test_cli_init.py"
Task T022: "Contract test for init command with invalid manifest in tests/contract/test_cli_init.py"
Task T023: "Contract test for init command exit codes in tests/contract/test_cli_init.py"
Task T024: "Integration test for manifest parsing workflow in tests/integration/test_manifest_workflow.py"
Task T025: "Integration test for git subtree add operations in tests/integration/test_subtree_operations.py"
Task T026: "Unit test for XML parsing logic in tests/unit/test_manifest_parser.py"
Task T027: "Unit test for manifest validation rules in tests/unit/test_manifest_parser.py"
Task T028: "Unit test for workspace initialization logic in tests/unit/test_workspace.py"

# Verify all tests FAIL

# GREEN Phase - Launch parallel implementation tasks:
Task T029: "Implement XML parsing in src/manifest_parser.py"
Task T030: "Implement manifest validation in src/manifest_parser.py"
# Then sequential tasks T031-T040 as they build on each other
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Init)
   - Write ALL tests (T020-T028)
   - Verify ALL tests FAIL
   - Implement (T029-T040)
   - Verify ALL tests PASS
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Ready for initial release or demo

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (sync capability)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (bidirectional workflow)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (granular control)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (status reporting)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Init)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Sync) - can start in parallel after foundational
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Push) - can start in parallel after foundational
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Each developer follows TDD: write tests ‚Üí verify fail ‚Üí implement ‚Üí verify pass

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD NON-NEGOTIABLE**: Constitution requires red-green-refactor cycle
  - Write tests FIRST (T020-T028 before T029-T040)
  - Verify tests FAIL before implementation
  - Every public function/class MUST have tests
  - Test coverage MUST be ‚â•90%
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Test-First Examples

**User Story 1 - Init Command**:
1. Write test in `tests/contract/test_cli_init.py`:
   ```python
   def test_init_creates_git_repo_with_subtrees():
       # Arrange: create manifest
       # Act: run 'subrepo init manifest.xml'
       # Assert: .git exists, subtrees at correct paths
   ```
2. Run test ‚Üí FAILS (command doesn't exist yet)
3. Implement init command in `src/cli.py`
4. Run test ‚Üí PASSES
5. Refactor if needed, keeping tests green

**User Story 2 - Sync Command**:
1. Write test in `tests/contract/test_cli_sync.py`:
   ```python
   def test_sync_updates_all_subtrees():
       # Arrange: initialized workspace, make upstream commits
       # Act: run 'subrepo sync'
       # Assert: subtrees updated to latest commits
   ```
2. Run test ‚Üí FAILS (sync command doesn't exist)
3. Implement sync command
4. Run test ‚Üí PASSES
5. Refactor while keeping tests green

This ensures code is testable by design and provides living documentation of behavior.
