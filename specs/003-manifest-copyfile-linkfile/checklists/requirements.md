- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (implicit - existing sync mechanism)

## Feature Readiness

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All criteria met

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the planning phase. The feature is clearly scoped to add copyfile and linkfile support to the existing git-repo manifest functionality.

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of both copyfile and linkfile functionality
- Well-prioritized user stories (P1: core functionality, P2: updates and error handling)
- Strong security considerations (path validation, symlink checks)
- Clear edge case identification

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if further refinement needed)
