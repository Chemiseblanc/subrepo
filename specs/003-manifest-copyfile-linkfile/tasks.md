# Tasks: Manifest Copyfile and Linkfile Support

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-manifest-copyfile-linkfile/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a constitutional requirement. All test tasks are included and MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single project structure: `subrepo/` for source, `tests/` for tests
- Paths follow plan.md structure

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Independent, can start after Foundational
  - User Story 2 (P1): Independent, can start after Foundational (parallel with US1)
  - User Story 3 (P2): Depends on US1 and US2 completion (extends their functionality)
  - User Story 4 (P2): Depends on US1 and US2 completion (error handling for them)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (can run parallel with US1)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 and US2 - Extends re-sync behavior for both
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on US1 and US2 - Adds error handling for both

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD requirement)
- All tests for a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models/parsing before file operations
- File operations before integration with SubtreeManager
- SubtreeManager integration before CLI display
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T001 and T002 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational) - Tests**:
- T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel

- T009 runs after T007, T008 (depends on Copyfile/Linkfile)
- T010 runs after T009 (depends on Project extension)

**Phase 3 (US1) - Tests**:
- T013-T024 can all run in parallel (different test files/test functions)

**Phase 3 (US1) - Implementation**:
- T029, T030 can run in parallel
- T031 runs after T030 (depends on validate_path_security)
- T032 runs after T031 (depends on copy_file)
- T033-T035 run sequentially (modify same files)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Test parse_project() extracts copyfile elements from XML in tests/unit/test_manifest_parser.py"
Task: "Test parse_project() creates Copyfile objects with correct src/dest in tests/unit/test_manifest_parser.py"
Task: "Test validate_path_security() rejects '..' components in tests/unit/test_file_operations.py"
Task: "Test copy_file() preserves permissions using shutil.copy2() in tests/unit/test_file_operations.py"
# ... all 16 tests can be written in parallel
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 & 2 Together

```bash
# Once Foundational phase complete, these can proceed in parallel:
Team A: Complete all of Phase 3 (User Story 1 - copyfile)
Team B: Complete all of Phase 4 (User Story 2 - linkfile)
# Both teams work independently, then integrate in Phase 5
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (exceptions)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (models, validation) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (copyfile)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (linkfile)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both copyfile and linkfile independently
6. Deploy/demo MVP with both P1 stories

**Rationale**: Both US1 and US2 are P1 (equally important) and provide complete git-repo manifest compatibility.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready ‚úì
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Copyfile works ‚úì
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Linkfile works ‚úì
4. **MVP COMPLETE** - Both P1 stories delivered
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Re-sync works ‚úì
6. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Error handling robust ‚úì
7. Polish ‚Üí Production ready ‚úì

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (4-6 hours)
2. Once Foundational complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (copyfile) - 28 tests + 7 implementation tasks
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (linkfile) - 12 tests + 6 implementation tasks
3. After US1 & US2 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (re-sync) - 5 tests + 2 implementation tasks
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (error handling) - 11 tests + 5 implementation tasks
4. Team completes Polish together

**Estimated Effort**:
- Setup: 1 hour
- Foundational: 4-6 hours (blocking)
- User Story 1: 8-12 hours
- User Story 2: 6-8 hours
- User Story 3: 2-4 hours
- User Story 4: 4-6 hours
- Polish: 2-4 hours
- **Total: 27-41 hours** (single developer) or **15-25 hours** (two developers in parallel)

## Notes

- **TDD Required**: All tests MUST be written first and FAIL before implementation (constitutional requirement)
- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests must fail before implementing (red-green-refactor)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- mypy --strict, ruff, black must pass before completion
- Coverage ‚â•90% enforced by pytest configuration
